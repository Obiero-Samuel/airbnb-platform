# Airbnb Project Frontend

This folder contains the frontend code for the Airbnb clone project.

## What the Code Does
- Displays property listings, details, and user profiles
- Handles user registration, login, and OTP verification
- Communicates with the backend via API calls
- Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Important Notes
- **Do NOT change anything in the registration, authentication, or OTP verification logic unless you know exactly what you are doing.**
- Changing API endpoints or request formats may break the connection with the backend.
- Image paths are organized in `assets/images/` by category (properties, users, icons, etc.)
- CSS files control layout and appearance. Only update styles if you want to change the look.

## Structure
- `pages/` - HTML pages (dashboard, properties, login, etc.)
- `js/` - JavaScript logic for API, authentication, properties, etc.
- `css/` - Stylesheets
- `assets/` - Images and icons

## How to View
1. Open `index.html` or any page in your browser
2. Make sure the backend server is running for full functionality
